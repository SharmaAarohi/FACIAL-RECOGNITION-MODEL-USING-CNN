# FACIAL-RECOGNITION-MODEL-USING-CNN
Face Key-Point Recognition model using CNN to predict the positions of keypoints on facial images, which can be utilized in various applications, including tracking faces in images and video, analyzing facial expressions, detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis, and face recognition.

This model was made as a part of a Hackathon called Normid, organized by Celestial Biscuit and sponsored by Devfolio, in March 2023. Although the project as a whole was made by our team (consisting of, and special thanks to 3 other people: Chhavi Verma, Arushi and Somya Sagar), the Python code of the model itself was built by me. The Learning Resource primarily used was: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/face-key-point-recognition-using-cnn/
